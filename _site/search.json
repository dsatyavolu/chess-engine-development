    "text": "Chess has been around since the 6th century, and in the 20th century, the game once studied by humans was conquered by computers. This began with IBM’s Deep Blue engine, which defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. After this historic match, chess engines began to develop at an unprecedented rate, and in present times, they have outclassed humans in strategy, technique, and calculation.\nTo begin with, let’s analyze how certain computers have scaled to the strength they possess today by comparing their growth with their human counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows the rating growth of Magnus Carlsen, a former world champion, and the chess engine Stockfish. Over the years, Carlsen has kept a steady rating of around 2800. In contrast, Stockfish’s rating has consistently increased at a unprecedented rate. Remarkably, by late 2011, Stockfish had achieved a rating higher than any human and has continued to improve since then."

(Free Internet Chess Server)\nData for the AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol and Deep Blue vs Garry Kasparov matches are posted on the internet. This information was put into a tibble.\n\n\nOther Sources\nThe use of artificial intelligence software such as ChatGPT and Copilot were used to help with the development of this project."

    "text": "In order to determine how the engines of Stockfish, Leela Chess Zero, and Komodo perform, we can visualize a graph of win percentage.\nWith this graph, it can be noted that Stockfish has the greatest win percentage, which is why it is in the argument as the greatest chess engine. Though, being a relatively new engine, Leela Chess Zero is catching up.\nWhat about the style of play of these engines? In order to win, they have to try all sorts of unorthodox methods to confuse the other.\nKomodo is an engine that goes for deep, strategic ideas, while Leela Chess Zero is known to pounce upon their opponent with attacking chess."

    "text": "Other Computers\nAlong with chess, there are also been developments of computers such as AlphaGo. Created by Google’s Deep Mind program, AlphaGo is a computer that is designed to play go, a board game like chess.\nThough go is vastly different than chess in terms of the rules, board, and pieces, the engines of AlphaGo and AlphaZero run with the same idea.\nAs with in chess there was a match between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov, there was also a match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol in go. Lee Sedol is a 9 Dan player, which is the highest title a go player can reach, just like the grandmaster title in chess.\nLet’s see how the matches compare with the best humans in their respective games, against their computer counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the computers came out on top, we can see that Kasparov and Sedol were able to win, despite all the odds against them. Human intelligence is incredible!"

    "text": "Well, it seems that a comparison of humans and engines is settled, but how about an engine such as Stockfish paired up against other engine?\nNow, it can be argued that Stockfish is the strongest chess engine developed, but let us take a look at how it fairs against upcoming developmental engines such as Leela Chess Zero and Komodo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, this is interesting! Leela Chess Zero is a hundred or so rating points above Stockfish. Why is this the case? Well, Leela Chess Zero is designed with a method called “reinforcement learning.” This is a machine learning algorithm, which has been used in Google’s Deep Mind AlphaZero. Stockfish uses the “minimax” algorithm, which considers a set of potential strategist and chooses the best one, but is not close to the depth of Leela Chess Zero.\nNow, rating is one thing, but what about the wins and losses of these engines in tournaments such as the TCEC, or Top Chess Engine Championship? Let’s take a look in the next page."
