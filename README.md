# The Development of Chess Computers Across Decades
This is a repository for the data project of Kane's Data Science Bootcamp. This project is done by Dinesh Satyavolu, and is named: "Development of Chess Computers Across Decades"

Over the decades, chess computers have achieved unprecedented levels of strength. Data sourced from the CCRL (Computer Chess Rating Lists) was used to analyze these developments. This data was then graphed to illustrate the changes in ratings of various chess computers over time. Through rigorous analysis, it was observed that chess computers now have ratings several hundred points higher than those of human players. As a result, these computers primarily compete against each other, often employing unorthodox styles.

This project will analyse various factors that are different between humans and computers, as well as the comparisons between the engines themselves.
