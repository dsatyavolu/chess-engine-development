## Author

My name is Dinesh Satyavolu, and I am a rising senior at [Triangle Math and Science Academy](https://www.tmsaapex.org/) in Apex, North Carolina.

I have been passionate about chess since middle school and have been participating in tournaments since 2020. Given my deep interest in chess, I was eager to design an informative project that will encourage others to appreciate the game as much as I do. I was able to use data science resources to create the visuals for this project.

If you have any questions about this project, feel free to reach out to me at dineshsatyavolu2007@gmail.com.
