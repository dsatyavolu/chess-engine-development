# Over the decades, chess computers have achieved unprecedented levels of strength. 
# Data sourced from the CCRL (Computer Chess Rating Lists) was used to analyze these developments. 
# This data was then graphed to illustrate the changes in ratings of various chess computers over time. 
# Through rigorous analysis, it was observed that chess computers now have ratings several hundred points higher than those of human players. As a result, these computers primarily compete against each other, often employing unorthodox styles.
