# Chess computers across decades have reached unprecedented strengths, starting with the success of IBM computer Deep Blue. 
# A data set was sourced from CCRL (Computer Chess Rating Lists) to measure these developments. 
# The data was then used to graph out the changes in rating of top chess computers in an analytical format. 
# With rigorous analysis, it is noted that chess computers are several hundred rating points higher than humans, and now all compete among themselves with unorthodox styles.
